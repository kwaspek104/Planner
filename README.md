# Planner

## Description 

This is a simple daily planner application. It is designed to help you during work hours, so the times are set only from 9AM - 5PM. They are also color coded. If the time block hour is before the current hour, it will be grey. If it is after the current hour, it will be green. And if it is the current hour, it will be red. It will also of course save what you write, even after refreshing the page. 

Enjoy!
